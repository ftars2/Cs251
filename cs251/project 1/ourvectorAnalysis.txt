ourvector<5state>: this ourvecotr holds the structs of states that are used throughout
the entire code. by creating a ourvector of structs, i am able to easily access
information about a state using its index in the ourvector of states. this ourvector is 
created at the start of main (line 311) which is then accessed by reference through most 
if not all functions. because only 10 states were loaded, only 10 elements were inserted, then 
it is accessed thought the entire code by refference.

ourvector<i>: this ourvector represents all the basic ourvectors that I used throughout my
code, which includes the values of repnum and demnum, which are in the ourvector struct. 
I created a ourvector of this type on lines: 311, 212, and 77. on 311 I created the ourvector
of states which also created an ourvector for demnum as well as repnum. on 212 I created a
ourvector to count the total number of voters in each district. on line 77 I created a ourvector,
so i could print out the second files eligible_voters information in the order it was read. 
the last ourvector i created was not required for the code to work, however because of the output
format, this vecotr was required given my implementation of the code. in the load function 78 vectors would
be created because there were 10 states loaded in from each file, and 2 sub ourvectors were created for 
repnum and demnum, which would be 30 our vectors. I am unsure where they come in, but an additional 38 
ourvectors are made just from loading in the files. i could guess 2 come from the tem variable, however 
I cant see why more then that are created. 
 every time you make a call to stats, it creates 3 more ourvectors, and since stats was called 
4 times, there are 12 more ourvectors.
In total i account for +/-44 our vectors that were created and cant account for 36 of them.
